Every so often do I find myself pensive about altered scales and impossible interface structures in Redux.
You can catch me either with my bass guitar, coding or keeping up with the latest gbas gbos on Twitter

My tools for Beautification are:
 - React :heart:
 - React Native :purple_heart:
 - Typescript :fire:
 - Nodejs :sweat_drops:
 - Vuejs :collision:
 - Ionic React :dash:
 - Anything it takes to get the Job done :hammer:

Do not Invade the repositiories. For therein lies stashes and batches of half written projects.
